	<p>My name is Chen, Meng-Ze, you can also call me Jerry. I am a software engineer currently working at Taipei, Taiwan. </p>
	<p>
	I got my MSCS diploma from University of San Francisco and Bachelor's degree from National Yunlin University of Science and Technology.

    I am a Java lover and I have been working with it for about 4 years, it is also my most expert language. I have accomplished various web servers based on Java and Spring Boot. For example, I made a distributed storage system (like hdfs) by Java and Netty. Another example is I achived process a large amount of data with Spring Batch in current position. In summary, I am comfortable to build up any kind of software by Java.
    </p>

    Not only building Java applications, I am also able to build a fullstack web server by NodeJs with frameworks like NextJs, React.js, Express and Sequelize. Javascript is actually my second most proficient technology.
    When I was the second grade student in USF, I made a airbnb-like backend server, api endpoints are including <a href="https://github.com/mchen81/pocket-realtor-backend/tree/main/server/document">here</a>. <br/>
    Further more, I am also able to be working on frontend using framework of React.js and NextJs, though I don't draw pictures for UI. In brief, I can make some ui pages with backend server by my own. (I still love Java, though)
    </p>

	Besides creating web service, I have some knowledge about Machine Learning. I also did some works on this area on my github page. However, to be honest, I do not really like working with traning a model or dirty data pre-processing. 
	It's just to tedious to me, I cannot find any fun on any of that. Sorry about that :(( 
	</p>
    <p>
    Anyway, coding has been a big part of my life, it is merely a work for me. Designing and writing a program is really like playing a puzzle game. I enjoy the procedure of achieving any program, as long as it's challenging.
    I have built up many items that may interest you, I invite you to browse these projects on my github page. I'd like to demostrate my enthusiasm in programming so what why I built this page, I really wany to share you who I am and what I've done.
