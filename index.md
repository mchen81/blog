	<p>My name is Chen, Meng-Ze, you can also call me Jerry. I am a software engineer currently working at Taipei, Taiwan. </p>
	<p>
	Coding has been a big part of my life, it is merely a work for me. Designing and writing a program is really like playing a game. I enjoy the procedure of achieving a program, even it's simple. 
	</p>
	I made this website because I'd like to demostrate my enthusiasm in programming, I want to share you who I am and what I've done. </p>

    <p> BTW, I am still working on this website, so you might see some strange words. </p>
