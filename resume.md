**Buy-Tracker** - A web app tracking what you've payed. <span style="float: right; ">2019</span>  
When I was first in the US, I tried to write down my spending in some mobile app. It's painful bucause typing lots of items and prices from reciptes didn't make sense. I realized I could write an app to help me achieve that - ocr. Taking a phto then tracking is done - how beautiful it is. Therefore, I built this app and got famaliar with Spring Boot.

_But it didn't help a lot since I gotta take a really clear image. Even worse, it a web page but not a mobile app._
